**Connecting a Discord to repl**

With just three lines of code you can connect your Discord to repl!

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js')
```

This code imports the module to allow your repl to connect to Discord.

```js
const bot = new Discord.Client({intents: 131071})
```

This code creates a new Discord client and saves it to the variable "bot."
The client, is essentially a webpage that has access to Discord.

```js
bot.login("tokenhere")
```

Your bot's token is its password.

Now run your code and your bot should be online.
